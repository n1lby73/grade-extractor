# Student Results Report Generator API

This project provides an API for generating individual student report cards based on results stored in an Excel file (`result.xlsx`) and a template (`template.xlsx`). The API allows users to upload student result data, generate reports, and identify students who are on probation or termination based on their course scores. Additionally, v2 of the API allows students to view their results directly, retrieve data from Google Sheets, and interact with their course information.

## API Overview

The application is built using Flask and exposes several API endpoints for uploading data, generating reports, and managing student results. The v2 API also enables students to retrieve their results directly from Google Sheets, based on their login credentials and selected class.

### Available API Endpoints (v2)

- **POST /api/v2/login**: User login endpoint to authenticate and receive a JWT token.
- **POST /api/v2/extractClasses**: Fetches all available classes from the selected module in Google Sheets.
- **POST /api/v2/genResult**: Generates individual reports for students based on their selected class.

### Available API Endpoints (v1)

- **POST /api/v1/login**: User login endpoint to authenticate and receive a JWT token.
- **POST /api/v1/reg**: Registration endpoint for new users.
- **POST /api/v1/result**: Uploads the `result.xlsx` file (student results).
- **POST /api/v1/template**: Uploads the `template.xlsx` file (student report template).
- **GET /api/v1/extractClasses**: Fetches all classes listed in the uploaded results file.
- **POST /api/v1/genresult**: Generates individual reports for students based on the selected class.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-JWT-Extended
- openpyxl (for Excel file processing)
- Pandas (for processing student data)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

This project uses a REST API for interacting with the system. You will need to use HTTP requests to communicate with the API. You can use tools like **Postman** or **cURL**, or you can integrate the API calls into your own system.

### Version 1

To interact with the API, follow these steps:

-  User Authentication:
    -    Register or log in to the system to receive an authentication token.

- Upload Results Database:
    - Upload the student results file (result.xlsx) that contains student grades.

- Upload Template:
    - Upload the report template file (template.xlsx), which is used to generate individual student reports.

- Generate Reports:
    - Once the results and template are uploaded, select a class and generate individual student reports. These reports include details about probation or termination status based on student performance.

### Version 2

To interact with the API, follow these steps:

-  Extract Clases:
    -    First, send a request to the /api/v2/extractClasses endpoint to fetch the list of available classes. This allows the frontend to display the list of classes before the user logs in.

- Login:
    - After selecting a class, use the /api/v2/login endpoint to authenticate the user. Youâ€™ll need to include the class code, student ID, and password. Upon successful login, you will receive an authentication token.

- Generate Reports:
    - Once logged in, use the /api/v2/genResult endpoint along with the authentication token to generate individual student reports

## API Documentation

For full API endpoint details, including request bodies, responses, and authentication instructions, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://github.com/n1lby73/grade-extractor/tree/main/docs).

The documentation includes all necessary details to interact with the API, including:

- **Login:** Authentication process to obtain a JWT token.

- **Register:** Endpoint to register new users.

- **File Uploads:** How to upload results and template files.

- **Generate Reports:** Instructions for generating student reports by class.

### File Format Requirements

#### **`result.xlsx` (Student Data)**

- **Sheet Names**: Each sheet represents a class. The system will process sheets that contain "emy" or "ety" in their name and exclude sheets with "Assessment" or ">".
- **Row 3**: Contains the number of courses.
- **Row 5**: Contains course names.
- **Row 7 onward**: Contains student names in the format "Last Name, First Name, Middle Name".
- **Score Columns**: Student scores are listed next to their names.
- **Average Column**: The column after the last course column is for the average score.

#### **`template.xlsx` (Report Template)**

This template should contain placeholders for student names and course scores. The application will fill these placeholders with the data from the `result.xlsx` file.

## Authentication

- All endpoints except for **login** and **registration** require authentication.
- You must include the `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header in your requests to authenticated endpoints.
- The `access_token` is received upon successful login and is used to authenticate your requests.


## How to Test the API

To test the API, you can use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to send requests to the endpoints. Make sure to:
1. Register a user via the **/api/v1/reg** endpoint.
2. Log in using the **/api/v1/login** endpoint to retrieve the `access_token`.
3. Use the token to authenticate other API requests (e.g., upload files and generate reports).
